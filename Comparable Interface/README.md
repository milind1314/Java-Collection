Write a Program to perform sorting operation on Product class using ArrayList by implementing Comparable interface.

Create a BLC class Product.

Instance variables:
productNumber-private-Integer
productName-private-String
productPrice-private-Double

Create a parameterized constructor to initialize the instance variable of Product class.

Implement Comparable interface to write the logic to sort the Product class based on the Product Name.
